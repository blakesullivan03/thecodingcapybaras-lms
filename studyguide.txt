Module: Loops

Topic: For Loops
Lesson: A for loop is used for iterating over a sequence. 

This is less like the for keyword in other programming languages, and works more like an iterator method as found in other object-orientated programming languages.

With the for loop we can execute a set of statements, once for each item in a list, tuple, set etc.
